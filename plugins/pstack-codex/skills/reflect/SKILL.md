description: Spawn three parallel review subagents over the active transcript, surface learnings, and route each to a concrete edit on an existing skill. Use when the user says reflect.

# Reflect

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

## When to invoke

- The user said "reflect" or "$reflect".
- A complex task (5+ tool calls) just landed cleanly and the recipe is worth keeping.
- The agent hit dead ends, found the working path, and the path generalizes.
- The user corrected the agent's approach mid-task.
- A non-trivial workflow emerged that isn't captured anywhere.

Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## Process

### 1. Locate the active transcript

The parent finds its own transcript file before fanning out. Prefer native task
inspection. If you must read a local transcript, search only under
`${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/sessions/` for the exact current thread id and
verify the opening user message matches this conversation. Do not glob
unrelated sessions.

```bash
find "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/sessions" -name "*-${CODEX_THREAD_ID}.jsonl" -print 2>/dev/null
```

For each candidate, read its first `"type":"user"` line and check that `message.content` contains the conversation's opening user prompt. Take the matching path. If no path resolves, write a tight digest of the session and pass that instead.

### 2. Spawn three reviewers in parallel

One message, three subagents, each with a read-only or explicit no-edit brief.
Reviewers may need MCP access for context lookups. The prompt forbids file
writes. The parent applies edits.

Give each reviewer a fresh context. Follow `../poteto-mode/references/codex-delegation.md`.

| Lens | Prompt template |
|---|---|
| Judgment | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Pass each template verbatim, substituting the transcript path or digest where
marked. Reviewers return findings in the subagent response body.

### 3. Synthesize

One fresh synthesizer subagent. Give it a read-only or explicit no-edit
brief. The synthesizer's
quality check includes spot-verifying citations, which can require MCP access.
Use `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim, with each reviewer's full output
inlined where marked. The synthesizer returns a structured Accepted / Rejected
/ Backlog list.

### 4. Structural enforcement check

Sanity-check the synthesizer's Accepted list. For any item that would be enforced more reliably by a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check, move it from Accepted to Backlog. The synthesizer already applies this criterion; this is a final pass before edits land. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.

### 5. Apply

Before applying any Accepted edit, present the synthesizer's full Accepted/Rejected/Backlog output to the user and wait for explicit approval. The user picks which subset to apply and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent in the org; do not auto-apply.

Backlog items file to whatever devex / backlog tracker your team uses automatically. Those are tracker submissions, not skill edits. Only the Accepted list waits for approval.

For each approved Accepted item, follow the Routing field exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): parent does directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): draft it per the poteto-mode Authoring a skill playbook, then run the Eval playbook's draft / test / iterate loop.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but didn't trigger when it should have): rewrite the description to say what the skill does and when to use it, then re-test the trigger with the Eval playbook.
- `new skill: <kebab-name>`: create it per the Authoring a skill playbook. Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done. Skip this step if it doesn't.

### 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog filed to the devex tracker: `<issue title>` (`<tags>`). One line each.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.
