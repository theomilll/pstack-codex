# No comments

Spawn Comment Sicko. Act on accepted findings.

Defer to Comment Sicko's fresh perspective.

## Scope

Use the caller's files or diff. Otherwise use the current diff against the base branch, default `main`, including the working tree.

## Steps

1. Spawn one read-only or explicit no-edit review subagent. Pass the scope and
   the full prompt from `references/comment-sicko.md`. Do not paraphrase it.
   Follow `../poteto-mode/references/codex-delegation.md`.
2. Inspect its report and confirm the checkout stayed unchanged. Reject scope escapes, exception-protected deletions, misstated `MUST KILL` reasons, and flags that treat kept intentional code as guilty. Reshape flags on our-code surprises stay actionable. A keep survives only with proof it is about something we cannot change. Audit missed scoped lint and TypeScript suppressions. Correctness or safety suppressions stay actionable `MUST KILL`s. Before accepting thin `IMPORTANT` or `do not remove` findings, run `$how` or `$why` on their symbol. Rerun one rejected report with the failure named. Reject a second, report it open, and fail `$no-comments`.
3. Fix trivial accepted flags directly by deleting a dead path, dropping a parameter, or using the real API. If any fix needs a shape, run `$architect` once for the accepted set and surrounding code. Stop at the sketch. Architect shapes. Step 4 implements.
4. Implement the smallest root-cause fix in scope. Remove every named workaround. If the root cause is out of scope, land the smallest in-scope fix and report the rest open. The **principle-fix-root-causes** and **principle-redesign-from-first-principles** skills guide intent only. Neither authorizes widening the fence nor fixing instances outside it. Never bolt on symptom guards.
5. Constraint comments say `do not remove`, `do not change wording`, or `talk to X before changing`. Leave keeps about things we cannot change. Offer the cheapest in-scope type, runtime, test, or CI lint. Wait for interactive approval. Unattended and eval require caller pre-approval. If approved, encode then delete. Otherwise delete, report the constraint open, and sketch out-of-scope work.
6. Report the deletion count, restored comments, reruns, architect sketch, fixes, encoding offers, encodings, unenforced constraints, and other open work.
