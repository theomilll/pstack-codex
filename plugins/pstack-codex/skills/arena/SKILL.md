# Arena

Fan out N parallel attempts at the same task. Read every candidate end to end. Pick the strongest as the base. Graft the best ideas from the others into it. Verify the synthesized result.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything. The arena runs autonomously and the list keeps phases from silently disappearing.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Blind judge
4. Pick
5. Graft
6. Verify

## Phase A: Frame

The N candidates share a task contract, with a distinct exploration direction when useful. Get it right before spawning anything.

1. State the artifact each candidate is producing.
2. Derive the rubric. State what success looks like for *this* task, then turn it into 3-6 concrete gradeable criteria. Concrete: `Adds a --dry-run flag that skips writes`. Vague: `code is correct`. The rubric is the picker's tool in Phase D; candidates only see the task.
3. Choose enough runners to explore the relevant design directions. Give every
   runner a fresh context and the same task contract. When directions need
   deliberate coverage, assign a distinct hypothesis or structural constraint
   to each runner without changing the shared requirements.
4. Assign output paths. Each candidate writes to its own location (a git worktree where possible, otherwise `/tmp/arena-<slug>/candidate-<n>/`). N candidates writing to the same path is shared mutable state and fails the the **separate-before-serializing-shared-state** principle skill test.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn the N subagents in parallel up to the host's concurrency limit, using additional waves as needed. Create a distinct Git worktree before spawning each repository writer, then give it the exact path. Each child gets the task, the path to shared grounding, its own output path, and instructions to produce both the artifact and a short rationale. Read-only candidates can share a checkout. Follow `../poteto-mode/references/codex-delegation.md`.

The rationale is mandatory. Without it, the parent cannot tell whether a candidate's structure is principled or accidental, which makes Phase E grafting unreliable. Each rationale names the alternatives the candidate considered and what it rejected.

If a candidate fails to produce output, proceed with N-1 and note the dropout in the synthesis record.

## Phase C: Blind judge

After all Phase B candidates complete, spawn one read-only or no-edit judge in
a fresh, self-contained context. It sees the rubric and the candidates by
anonymous path label, without runner identities or the parent's preferred
answer. It scores each criterion and recommends a base with
rationale. It runs in parallel with the parent's reading in Phase D, not with
the candidates themselves. Spawning while candidates are still writing means
the judge sees partial or empty outputs and reports them as dropouts.

## Phase D: Pick a base

Read every candidate end to end before picking. Skimming N candidates surfaces only the candidate whose surface looks most familiar.

Score each candidate against the rubric criterion by criterion, not on holistic feel. Compare against the blind judge. Agreement on the base confirms the pick. Disagreement means one of you is biased or the rubric was ambiguous. Read both rationales before deciding.

Pick the base on which candidate a future maintainer can extend most easily without breaking invariants. Prefer the cleaner boundary or smaller surface area when two feel tied, per the Laziness Protocol.

Record the pick and the reason in a short synthesis note alongside the base artifact, including the blind judge's verdict.

## Phase E: Graft

Walk each losing candidate once more and identify what is worth porting into the base. The signal is usually one or two things per candidate, not most of it.

Fold each graft in by hand, per the **redesign-from-first-principles** principle skill. Don't paste mechanically. The result has to remain coherent under one mental model.

Record what was grafted, from which candidate, and what was rejected and why. The rejection notes are the highest-signal part of the record. Future readers learn from what you considered and dropped, not just what you kept.

When candidates converge on the same shape, record that agreement and verify the shared assumptions; repeated agreement is not proof. No graft is needed when the best result is already coherent. When candidates diverge, compare the tradeoffs against the contract. Reframe and re-run only if the requirements were too ambiguous to judge.

## Phase F: Verify

The synthesized artifact has to hold up under the same scrutiny as any other output, per the **prove-it-works** principle skill. The arena does not earn you a pass.

If verification surfaces a problem the arena did not catch, either Phase A was wrong (re-frame and re-run) or one candidate caught it and you missed the graft (go back to Phase E). Don't paper over.

## Outputs

One synthesized artifact. One short synthesis note alongside, naming the base, the grafts (with source candidate), the rejections, the dropouts if any, and the verification result.
